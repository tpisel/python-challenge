# python-challenge

No external code or other content has been used in this project, except where specifically provided in the assignment resources.

The code for both PyBank and PyPoll are kept in their respective folders as `main.py`. Each can be run with `python main.py` in terminal. This will write the analysis output to the terminal and to an `output.txt` file in the respective folder.
